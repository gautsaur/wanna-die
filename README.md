# wanna-die-

This is a Goth-themed WPF horror game where you can fight with monsters in a world map and either win your way out or die.

Written in C# as a WPF application, this game uses multiple XAML Windows to move you thorugh each step.

This was created as a part of creative project in university curriculum which required Object-Oriented Programming.

You can play the game itself by downloading the [.exe](Deliverable 7/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
